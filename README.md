# 3D-Surface-Visualization-QT-QML
QML QT desktop application used for 3D-Surface visualization.
-I constructed a QAbstractListModel for custom list created in C++ to be exposed into QML (front-end)
-Also bound QML singal to invoke C++ method so that new data can be refreshed and uploaded into QML ListModel.
-Finally used QinstallerFramework to wrap the application into installer .exe
